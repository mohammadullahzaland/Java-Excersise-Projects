Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to the end-of-chapter exercises from the book:

Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures
Comprehensive Version, 12th Edition — by Y. Daniel Liang

Naming Rule

Each file is named using this format:

CXXEYY_Description.java

C = Chapter number

E = Exercise number

Description = what the program does

Example:

C02E01_CelsiusToFahrenheit.java

C03E05_FindFutureDate.java

Purpose

I created this repository to practice Java programming and improve my problem-solving skills. I will continue adding more solutions as I progress through the book.
